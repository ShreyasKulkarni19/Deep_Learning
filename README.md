# Deep_Learning

Here I have uploaded two assignments which then are used in the final project.
1. Assignment 1 was a normal presentation.
2. Assignment 2 is where we created folders having their respective images. Folder names are based on the location of infarct.
3. We make use of masking to extract the required text or detect something.
4. Final project is where we predict the ;location of infarct depending on the MRI scan that we feed into the network.
